Mainnet launch configuration
============================

Running:

    eos-bios boot

will give you something very close to what existed at the time of
launch, including an old version of nodeos, and system contracts at
the time.  A sample of the snapshot will be included only. Tweak
`boot_sequence.yaml` to load them all.
