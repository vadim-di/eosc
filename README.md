`eosc` command-line swiss-army-knife
-------------------------------

[点击查看中文](./README-cn.md)

`eosc` is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux) command-line tool
for interacting with an EOS.IO blockchain.

It contains tools for voting and a Vault to securely store private
keys.

It is based on the `eos-go` library, used in `eos-bios`.

This first release holds simple tools, but a whole `cleos`-like
swiss-army-knife is being developed and will be released shortly after
mainnet launch.  Source code for most operations is already available
in this repository.


Installation
------------

1. Install from https://github.com/vadim-di/eosc/releases

**or**

2. Build from source with:

```bash
go get -u -v github.com/vadim-di/eosc/eosc
```

**or**

3. If you are on **MacOS** and use **Homebrew**:

```
brew install eoscanada/tap/eosc
```


Vote now!
---------

Once installed run:

```
eosc vault create --import
```

to import your keys and follow instructions.

Then run:

```
eosc vote --help
```

and run something like this:

```
eosc vote producers [your account] [producer1] [producer2] [producer3]
```

Make sure you have version `v0.7.0` or higher:

```
eosc version
```

Read more below for details.


eosc vault
----------

The `eosc vault` is a simple yet powerful EOS wallet.



Import keys in new wallet
=========================

You can **import externally generated private keys** with `vault create --import` call.

You will then be asked to paste your private key in an interactive
prompt.  The private key is **not shown** on screen during the
import. It will display the corresponding public key which you should
cross-check.

```
$ eosc vault create --import -c "Imported key"
Enter passphrase to encrypt your vault: ****
Confirm passphrase: ****
Type your first private key: ****
Type your next private key or hit ENTER if you are done:
Imported 1 keys. Let's secure them before showing the public keys.
Wallet file "./eosc-vault.json" created. Here are your public keys:
- EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
```

Your private keys will be encrypted using your passphrase. See below
for cryptographic primitives used.



New wallet with new keys
========================

Create a new wallet with:

```
$ eosc vault create --keys 2
Created 2 keys. Let's secure them before showing the public keys.
Enter passphrase to encrypt your keys:
Confirm passphrase:
Wallet file "./eosc-vault.json" created. Here are your public keys:
- EOS7MEGq9FVb2Ve4bsZEan1t146TKCyo8dKtLvihrNhGbPLCPLjXd
- EOS5QoyZwJvpPjmZAa3HdgTn2FdNABBffXLD95WPagiARmaAHMhin
```


Add keys to an existing vault
=============================

To add an externally generated private key to an existing vault, use:

```
$ eosc vault add
Vault file not found, creating a new wallet
Type your first private key:        [insert your private key here, NOT shown]
Type your next private key or hit ENTER if you are done:
Keys imported. Let's secure them before showing the public keys.
Enter passphrase to encrypt your keys:
Confirm passphrase:
Wallet file "./eosc-vault.json" written. Here are your ADDED public keys:
- EOS5tb61aZMAfQqKDsnkscFq76JXxNdi7ZhkUmkVZUkU4zPzfeAFx
Total keys writteN: 3
```

The vault operations do zero network calls and can be done offline.
The file is encrypted, can safely be archived and is future proof.

Casting your votes
------------------

With an `eosc-vault.json`, you can vote:

```
$ eosc vote producers youraccount eoscanadacom someotherfavo riteproducer
Enter passphrase to unlock vault:
Voter [youraccount] voting for: [eoscanadacom]
Done
```

This will sign your vote transaction locally, and submit the
transaction to the network through the `https://mainnet.eoscanada.com`
endpoint.  You can also point to some other endpoints that are on the
main network with `-u` or `--api-url`.

Find what your account is on https://eosq.app



Cryptographic primitives used
-----------------------------

The cryptography used is NaCl
([C implementation](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/), [Javascript port](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js),
[Go version, which we use](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox)). And
key derivation is [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2),
using the [Go library
here](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/argon2).

You can inspect the crypto code in our codebase regarding the
`passphrase` implementation: [it is 61 lines](./vault/passphrase.go),
including blanks and comments.



## Offline transaction signature


`eosc` has everything needed for managing an airtight offline wallet.
Here is a sample use. From within `/tmp/airtight`, run:

* `eosc vault create --import --comment "Airtight wallet"`

which will output:
```
PLEASE READ:
We are now going to ask you to paste your private keys, one at a time.
They will not be shown on screen.
Please verify that the public keys printed on screen correspond to what you have noted

Paste your first private key:       <em>[PASTE PRIVATE KEY HERE]</em>
- Scanned private key corresponding to EOS5J53bNtH5H1bJTyP237fr5LF6eQSQohfGY5iMCgpC4HpXApJBr
Paste your next private key or hit ENTER if you are done:           <em>[PASTE SECOND PRIVATE KEY HERE]</em>
- Scanned private key corresponding to EOS6tgsdv6S7N1GYWgX8QEBAsanAwXwuaEkv11GGtteyk5ELqSzVP
Paste your next private key or hit ENTER if you are done:           <em>[HIT ENTER HERE]</em>
Imported 2 keys.

You will be asked to provide a passphrase to secure your newly created vault.
Make sure you make it long and strong.

Enter passphrase to encrypt your vault:       <em>[ENTER YOUR PASSPHRASE HERE]</em>
Confirm passphrase:                           <em>[RE-ENTER YOUR PASSPHRASE HERE]</em>

Wallet file "./eosc-vault.json" written to disk.
Here are the keys that were ADDED during this operation (use `list` to see them all):
- EOS5J53bNtH5H1bJTyP237fr5LF6eQSQohfGY5iMCgpC4HpXApJBr
- EOS6tgsdv6S7N1GYWgX8QEBAsanAwXwuaEkv11GGtteyk5ELqSzVP
Total keys stored: 2
```

This operation creates your `eosc-vault.json` wallet.  It can be done
completely offline as it does not touch the network at all.

Now, let's try using it. Issue those commands from a computer with internet access (which in turn does not have access to your eosc vault wallet):

* `eosc transfer airtight11111 cancancan123 1.0000 -m "Can't say I haven't paid you now" --write-transaction transaction.json --skip-sign --expiration 3600`

This will output:

```

Transaction written to "../transaction.json"
Sign offline with: --offline-chain-id=5fff1dae8dc8e2fc4d5b23b2c7665c97f9e9d8edf2b6485a86ba311c25639191
Above is a pretty-printed representation of the outputted file
```

Now copy the `transaction.json` file to another computer. Note the `--offline-chain-id=...` output above.

On the airtight computer, run:

* `eosc tx sign path/to/transaction.json --offline-sign-key EOS6tgsdv6S7N1GYWgX8QEBAsanAwXwuaEkv11GGtteyk5ELqSzVP  --offline-chain-id=5fff1dae8dc8e2fc4d5b23b2c7665c97f9e9d8edf2b6485a86ba311c25639191 --write-transaction signedtx.json`

You can enter as many `--offline-sign-key` as you want, or separate each entry with a `,` (comma), like this: `--offline-sign-key EOS6tgsdv6S7N1GYWgX8QEBAsanAwXwuaEkv11GGtteyk5ELqSzVP,EOS5J53bNtH5H1bJTyP237fr5LF6eQSQohfGY5iMCgpC4HpXApJBr`.  This will output:

```
Enter passphrase to decrypt your vault:

Transaction written to "signedtx.json"
Sign offline with: --offline-chain-id=5fff1dae8dc8e2fc4d5b23b2c7665c97f9e9d8edf2b6485a86ba311c25639191
Above is a pretty-printed representation of the outputted file
```

You are now ready to bring `signedtx.json` back to the online computer, and run:

* `eosc tx push signedtx.json`

This will succeed, in which case you're done, or fail with some of these:

* `transaction bears irrelevant signatures from these keys: [\"EOS5J53bNtH5H1bJTyP237fr5LF6eQSQohfGY5iMCgpC4HpXApJBr\"]`: this means you didn't need to sign with this key to authorize the `actor@permission` you specified in the transaction's actions.

* `UnAuthorized` errors: this means you have not signed the
  transaction with the keys required to authorize the
  `actor@permission` specified in the transaction's actions.

* `Transaction's reference block did not match.`: this means you
  didn't create the transaction from the same chain you're trying to
  push it to.

* `expired transaction`: you need to do the whole loop within the
  timeframe of the original `--expiration`. If you give `--expiration`
  more than an hour, note that you can only submit the transaction to
  the chain in the last hour of expiration.

* some other assertion errors, which are normal errors that would have
  occurred if you tried to sign it online, investigate with the
  contract in question.



### Offline multisig

For added security with offline transaction signing, consider using
the `multisig` facility of the EOS blockchain.

It is possible to propose a transaction on-chain (through `eosc
multisig propose`), reviewable by all, and prepare an offline
transaction simply to approve that transaction.  Using this method,
you could have X number of airtight computers that each provide one
piece of the puzzle, controlled by different individuals, without the
need to stitch transaction files, or gather signatures into a single
place.



FAQ
---

Q: Why not use `cleos` instead ?

A: `cleos` is hard to compile, being in C++, as it requires a huge
toolchain.  `eosc` works on Windows where `cleos` doesn't.  `eosc`
contains a wallet inside, and is able to use it to sign some
transactions, `cleos` interfaces with yet another program (`keosd`) in
order to sign transactions, making it more complex to use. `eosc`
brings `keosd` and `cleos` together in a swiss-army-knify package.
